# Picture Header Project
In a recent interview with a company I mentioned to the interviewers I liked how their landing page's header looked/functioned and was going to figure out how it was implemented without hitting the inspect tool. 

Being one to always follow through on what I say I'm going to do, I took an hour and implemented it.
(I use a fictitious travel company for the implementation to keep the company anonymous.)

The thing that caught my eye was how the navigation was encapsulated within the image, but when a user scrolls down, the background of the header changes from transparent to white, and the text color changes as well. The header then returns to transparent when the user scrolls back to the top.

To implement the change, I used a simple instance of the Intersection API.
I went on to build the next two sections of their landing page (just because).
I added lazy loading of the "case study" images and animation on the case study text banners to liven the page up.
